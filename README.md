# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repo is a list of specifications and realisations of various data structures and algorithms.

I was inspired by Berkeley's CS 61B: Data Structures and Algorithms (2023 Fall: Lecture 3) and MIT's 6.006: Introduction to Algorithms (2020 Spring: Lecture 2).

## Structure of this repo

Each Data Structure will have its own folder containing a language realisation.

This repo will grow so I do not know how to continue this file.
